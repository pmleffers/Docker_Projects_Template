# Docker Projects Template

This is a repository space for a template docker setup that can be built to run Jupyter Notebooks for various projects. Reading through the instructions should help to solidify the idea.

Step 1) docker clone https://github.com/pmleffers/Docker_Projects_Template

Step 2) Modify requirements.py 

          -- Add any additional packages you would like to install and have available for the docker container. So for example if you want   to make the container designed for Tensorflow, add the Tensorflow installation packagas. Or if you want to make the container designed to run Dask, add dask installation instructions for building the container.
